In this position paper, we identify key properties of OSS licenses, present a license analysis scheme, and discuss our approach for automatically analyzing license interactions.}, booktitle={2009 ICSE Workshop on Emerging Trends in Free/Libre/Open Source Software Research and Development}, publisher={IEEE}, author={Alspaugh, Thomas A. and Asuncion, Hazeline U. and Scacchi, Walt}, year={2009}, month={May}, pages={54–57} }

Our paper suggests that the occupational choices of programmers based on reputation incentives determine the qualities of programs. A monopolist has to take into account the free software in the consumer market. When software implementation costs are low, the monopolist accepts the copyleft program in the market. We explain the simultaneous existence of commercial and copylefted programs, like Windows and Linux, and also why commercial alternatives to copyleft programs may not exist.}, number={1}, journal={Information Economics and Policy}, author={Mustonen, Mikko}, year={2003}, month={Mar}, pages={99–121} }

 @article{Sabetta_Bezzi_2018, title={A Practical Approach to the Automatic Classification of Security-Relevant Commits}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02458}, abstractNote={The lack of reliable sources of detailed information on the vulnerabilities of open-source software (OSS) components is a major obstacle to maintaining a secure software supply chain and an effective vulnerability management process. Standard sources of advisories and vulnerability data, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), are known to suffer from poor coverage and inconsistent quality. To reduce our dependency on these sources, we propose an approach that uses machine-learning to analyze source code repositories and to automatically identify commits that are security-relevant (i.e., that are likely to fix a vulnerability). We treat the source code changes introduced by commits as documents written in natural language, classifying them using standard document classification methods. Combining independent classifiers that use information from different facets of commits, our method can yield high precision (80.}, note={arXiv: 1807.02458}, journal={arXiv:1807.02458 [cs]}, author={Sabetta, Antonino and Bezzi, Michele}, year={2018}, month={Jul} }

 @article{Haefliger_von, title={Code Reuse in Open Source Software}, volume={54}, ISSN={0025-1909}, DOI={10.1287/mnsc.1070.0748}, abstractNote={Code reuse is a form of knowledge reuse in software development that is fundamental to innovation in many fields. However, to date there has been no systematic investigation of code reuse in open source software projects. This study uses quantitative and qualitative data gathered from a sample of six open source software projects to explore two sets of research questions derived from the literature on software reuse in firms and open source software development. We find that code reuse is extensive across the sample and that open source software developers, much like developers in firms, apply tools that lower their search costs for knowledge and code, assess the quality of software components, and have incentives to reuse code. Open source software developers reuse code because they want to integrate functionality quickly, because they want to write preferred code, because they operate under limited resources in terms of time and skills, and because they can mitigate development costs through code reuse.}, number={1}, journal={Management Science}, author={Haefliger, Stefan and von Krogh, Georg and Spaeth, Sebastian}, year={2007}, month={Nov}, pages={180–193} }

 @article{Colazo_Fang_2009, title={Impact of license choice on Open Source Software development activity}, volume={60}, ISSN={1532-2882}, DOI={10.1002/asi.21039}, abstractNote={Abstract The Open Source Software (OSS) development model has emerged as an important competing paradigm to proprietary alternatives; however, insufficient research exists to understand the influence of some OSS project characteristics on the level of activity of the development process. A basic such characteristic is the selection of the project’s software license. Drawing upon social movement theory, our study examined the relationship between OSS licenses and project activity. Some OSS licenses include a ?copyleft? clause, which requires that if derivative products are to be released, it must be done under the license the original product had. We hypothesize that copylefted licenses, as opposed to noncopylefted licenses, are associated with higher developer membership and coding activity, faster development speed, and longer developer permanence in the project. To test the hypotheses, we used archival data sources of working OSS projects spanning several years of development time. We discuss practical and theoretical implications of the results as well as future research ideas.}, number={5}, journal={Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology}, author={Colazo, Jorge and Fang, Yulin}, year={2009}, month={Feb}, pages={997–1011} }
