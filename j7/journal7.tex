  \section{Entry}
  I have found new papers and came up with a new acronym, VITAL, that falls under the risk section of third-party dependencies. V is for value. I is for impact. T is for track. A is for administration. L is for licensing. These are all areas that should be considered from a software engineer perspective as they include third-party dependencies. I am feeling better about my survey paper and will have a final draft turned in.
