  \section{Survey Paper Learning Process}
  % Some journals put the first two words in caps:
  \IEEEPARstart{I} am still struggling to find 30 sources for the paper. I have just over half. I am revisiting the papers I currently have to see how I am going to go about creating some sort of coherent story out of the sources I have picked. I think I might be spending too much time on each research paper and will need to get back into scanning papers like we talked about earlier in the semester. This has been a rough assignment and I'm not exactly sure why other than the amount of concentration that it requires.
