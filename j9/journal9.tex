  \section{Entry}
  The AWS assignment was fun. I had problems getting the microphone to work but I was able to describe my process in the comments. The only issue I ran into was generating keys so that I could SSH on to the box. I was expecting up upload a public key but instead downloaded a key provided by Amazon.
