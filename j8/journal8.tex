  \section{Entry}
 I have continued working towards the VITAL acronym collecting sources and organizing. I have also found some interesting commercial companies that have applied some of the research so I have included some of those examples as well. I am not sure if surveying academic and industry sources will work in a survey paper but sometimes the state of the art comes from industry.
