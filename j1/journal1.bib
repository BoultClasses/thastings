@inproceedings{historical_software_vulnerability, title={Using historical software vulnerability data to forecast future vulnerabilities}, DOI={10.1109/RWEEK.2015.7287429}, abstractNote={The field of network and computer security is a never-ending race with attackers, trying to identify and patch software vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. In this ongoing conflict, it would be quite useful to be able to predict when and where the next software vulnerability would appear. The research presented in this paper is the first step towards a capability for forecasting vulnerability discovery rates for individual software packages. This first step involves creating forecast models for vulnerability rates at the global level, as well as the category (web browser, operating system, and video player) level. These models will later be used as a factor in the predictive models for individual software packages. A number of regression models are fit to historical vulnerability data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to identify historical trends in vulnerability discovery. Then, k-NN classification is used in conjunction with several time series distance measurements to select the appropriate regression models for a forecast. 68% and 95% confidence bounds are generated around the actual forecast to provide a margin of error. Experimentation using this method on the NVD data demonstrates the accuracy of these forecasts, as well as the accuracy of the confidence bounds forecasts. Analysis of these results indicates which time series distance measures produce the best vulnerability discovery forecasts.}, booktitle={2015 Resilience Week (RWS)}, author={Last, D.}, year={2015}, month={Aug}, pages={1–7} }

This is due in part to the need for defenders to protect against the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities which they may not yet know exist. If network defenders were able to forecast the location and severity of zero-day vulnerabilities that would be discovered in the near future, this would be a valuable tool. This paper describes ongoing research that seeks to develop Vulnerability Discovery Models that will provide forecasts for zero-day vulnerability discovery rates. The initial work addresses forecasts at the global and category (web browser, operating system, and video player) levels, and this will be extended to individual software applications in the future. This research has developed three distinct zero-day vulnerability forecast suites, one based on regression and two based on machine learning. The accuracy of several of the forecast models from each forecast suite is evaluated, and the results are promising for the future development of these forecast models. Future work in this area will involve combining individual forecast models into a consensus forecast model, as well as extending the forecast models to the software application level.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 11th Annual Cyber and Information Security Research Conference}, publisher={ACM}, author={Last, David}, year={2016}, pages={13:1–13:4}, collection={CISRC ’16} }

This approach often leads to problems, which most of the times translate into security vulnerabilities. From the viewpoint of the traditional security paradigm, it should be possible to eliminate such problems through better integration of security and software engineering. This paper firstly argues for the need to develop a methodology that considers security as an integral part of the whole system development process, and secondly it contributes to the current state of the art by proposing an approach that considers security concerns as an integral part of the entire system development process and by relating this approach with existing work. The different stages of the approach are described with the aid of a real-life case study; a health and social care information system.}, number={8}, journal={Information Systems}, author={Mouratidis, Haralambos and Giorgini, Paolo and Manson, Gordon}, year={2005}, month={Dec}, pages={609–629} }

Many software security metrics have been proposed e.g., complexity metrics, cohesion and coupling metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel code metric based on dependency graphs to predict vulnerable components. To validate the efficiency of the proposed metric, we conduct a prediction model which targets the JavaScript Engine of Firefox. In this experiment, our prediction model has obtained a very good result in term of accuracy and recall rates. This empirical result is a good evidence showing dependency graphs are also a good option for early indicating vulnerability.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Security Measurements and Metrics}, publisher={ACM}, author={Nguyen, Viet Hung and Tran, Le Minh Sang}, year={2010}, pages={3:1–3:8}, collection={MetriSec ’10} }

Although several vulnerability prediction models have been proposed, such models have shortcomings and do not consider trend, level, and seasonality components of vulnerabilities. Through time series analysis, this study built predictive models for five popular web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera and for all reported vulnerabilities elsewhere. Results showed that time series models provide a good fit to our vulnerability datasets and can be useful for vulnerability prediction. Results also suggested that the level of the series is the best estimator of the prediction models.}, journal={Computers and Security}, author={Roumani, Yaman and Nwankpa, Joseph K. and Roumani, Yazan F.}, year={2015}, month={Jun}, pages={32–40} }
